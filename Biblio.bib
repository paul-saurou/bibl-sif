For security and efﬁciency reasons a common design practice simply modiﬁes some parameters of widely used and well studied encryption standards. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of reverse engineering the secret speciﬁcations of an AES-like block cipher by a FIRE attack based on Ineffective Fault Analysis (IFA) or by SCARE techniques based on two models of collision power analysis. In the considered fault or observational models, we demonstrate that an adversary who does not know the secret key can recover the full set of secret parameters of an AES-like software implementation and, in some models, even if it is protected by common Boolean masking and shufﬂing of independent operations. We thereby intend to demonstrate that protecting the implementation of such AES-like function is not an option even if its speciﬁcations are not public.},

We present two new attacks that only require known plaintext or ciphertext. The first one targets a stream cipher and points out how an attacker can recover unknown linear parts of an algorithm which is in our case the parameters of a Linear Feedback Shift Register. The second technique allows to retrieve an unknown non-linear function such as a substitution box. It can be applied on every kind of symmetric algorithm (typically Feistel or Substitution Permutation Network) and also on stream ciphers. Twelve years after the first publication about side-channel attacks, we show that the potential of these analyses has been initially seriously under-estimated. Every cryptography, either public or secret, is indeed at risk when implemented in a device accessible by an attacker. This illustrates how vulnerable cryptography is without a trusted tamper-proof hardware support.}

The attack is based on the identifying equal intermediate results from power measurements while the actual values of these intermediates remain unknown. A powerful attack on substitution blocks can be mounted if the same table is used in multiple iterations and if cross-iteration comparisons are possible. Adversaries can use the method as a part of reverse engineering tools on secret algorithms. In addition to the described method, other methods have to be employed to completely restore the algorithm and its accompanying secret key. We have successfully used the method in a demonstration attack on a secret authentication and session-key generation algorithm implemented on SIM cards in GSM networks. The ﬁndings provide guidance for designing smartcard solutions that are secure against this kind of attack.},

	abstractnote = {Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) is commonly used to recover secret keys involved in the implementation of publicly known cryptographic algorithms. On the other hand, Side-Channel Analysis for Reverse Engineering (SCARE) considers an adversary who aims at recovering the secret design of some cryptographic algorithm from its implementation. Most of previously published SCARE attacks enable the recovery of some secret parts of a cipher design –e.g. the substitution box(es)– assuming that the rest of the cipher is known. Moreover, these attacks are often based on idealized leakage assumption where the adversary recovers noise-free side-channel information. In this paper, we address these limitations and describe a generic SCARE attack that can recover the full secret design of any iterated block cipher with common structure. Speciﬁcally we consider the family of Substitution-Permutation Networks with either a classical structure (as the AES) or with a Feistel structure. Based on a simple and usual assumption on the side-channel leakage we show how to recover all parts of the design of such ciphers. We then relax our assumption and describe a practical SCARE attack that deals with noisy side-channel leakages.},

	abstractnote = {In this paper, we provide a necessary clarification of the good security properties that can be obtained from parallel implementations of masking schemes. For this purpose, we first argue that (i) the probing model is not straightforward to interpret, since it more naturally captures the intuitions of serial implementations, and (ii) the noisy leakage model is not always convenient, e.g. when combined with formal methods for the verification of cryptographic implementations. Therefore we introduce a new model, the bounded moment model, that formalizes a weaker notion of security order frequently used in the side-channel literature. Interestingly, we prove that probing security for a serial implementation implies bounded moment security for its parallel counterpart. This result therefore enables an accurate understanding of the links between formal security analyses of masking schemes and experimental security evaluations based on the estimation of statistical moments. Besides its consolidating nature, our work also brings useful technical contributions. First, we describe and analyze refreshing and multiplication algorithms that are well suited for parallel implementations and improve security against multivariate side-channel attacks. Second, we show that simple refreshing algorithms (with linear complexity) that are not secure in the continuous probing model are secure in the continuous bounded moment model. Eventually, we discuss the independent leakage assumption required for masking to deliver its security promises, and its specificities related to the serial or parallel nature of an implementation.},

These attacks can break implementations and countermeasures whose security is dependent on the assumption that an adversary cannot obtain more than one or a limited number of side channel samples. They require that an adversary has access to an identical experimental device that he can program to his choosing. The success of these attacks in such constraining situations is due manner in which noise within each sample is handled. In contrast to previous approaches which viewed noise as a hindrance that had to be reduced or eliminated, our approach focuses on precisely modeling noise, and using this to fully extract information present in a single sample. We describe in detail how an implementation of RC4, not amenable to techniques such as SPA and DPA, can easily be broken using template attacks with a single sample. Other applications include attacks on certain DES implementations which use DPA–resistant hardware and certain SSL accelerators which can be attacked by monitoring electromagnetic emanations from an RSA operation even from distances of ﬁfteen feet.},

Then we address the problem of heterogeneous leakage pointed out by G´erard and Standaert (when the leakage noise is diﬀerent from one Sbox output to the others due for instance to implementation particularities or resynchronisation reasons), by inserting an eﬃcient termination algorithm in the key-recovery phase of the attack. In a last contribution, we compare (over simulations and real experiments) the enhanced collision-correlation attack and the 2nd-order CPA attack. Similarly to the results of G´erard and Standaert, we show – in the context of masked implementations – the superiority of 2nd-order CPA when its leakage model is not too far from the real leakage function.},

In this paper, we discuss their relevance in the security evaluation of leaking devices with two main contributions. On the one hand, we suggest that the exploitation of linear collisions in block ciphers can be naturally re-written as a Low Density Parity Check Code decoding problem. By combining this re-writing with a Bayesian extension of the collision detection techniques, we succeed in improving the eﬃciency and error tolerance of previously introduced attacks. On the other hand, we provide various experiments in order to discuss the practicality of such attacks compared to standard DPA. Our results exhibit that collision attacks are less eﬃcient in classical implementation contexts, e.g. 8-bit microcontrollers leaking according to a linear power consumption model. We also observe that the detection of collisions in software devices may be diﬃcult in the case of optimized implementations, because of less regular assembly codes. Interestingly, the soft decoding approach is particularly useful in these more challenging scenarios. Finally, we show that there exist (theoretical) contexts in which collision attacks succeed in exploiting leakages whereas all other non-proﬁled side-channel attacks fail.},

It happens that the attack asymptotic strength is not related to the acquisition conditions, but only to the algorithm implemen- tation. In the case of an iterative implementation of a Feis- tel cipher, we show that the customarily used power mod- els are valid. Within this theoretical framework, the attack strength depends only on the substitution boxes mathemat- ical properties.

	abstractnote = {A large variety of side channel analyses performed on embedded devices involve the linear correlation coefficient as wrong-key distinguisher. This coefficient is actually a sound statistical tool to quantify linear dependencies between univariate variables. However, when those dependencies are non-linear, the correlation coefficient stops being pertinent so that another statistical tool must be investigated. Recent works showed that the Mutual Information measure is a promising candidate, since it detects any kind of statistical dependency. Substituting it for the correlation coefficient may therefore be considered as a natural extension of the existing attacks. Nevertheless, the first applications published at CHES 2008 have revealed several limitations of the approach and have raised several questions. In this paper, an in-depth analysis of side channel attacks involving the mutual information is conducted. We expose their theoretical foundations and we assess their limitations and assets. Also, we generalize them to higher orders where they seem to be an efficient alternative to the existing attacks. Eventually, we provide simulations and practical experiments that validate our theoretical analyses.}

	abstractnote = {In this paper, we provide a necessary clariﬁcation of the good security properties that can be obtained from parallel implementations of masking schemes. For this purpose, we ﬁrst argue that (i) the probing model is not straightforward to interpret, since it more naturally captures the intuitions of serial implementations, and (ii) the noisy leakage model is not always convenient, e.g. when combined with formal methods for the veriﬁcation of cryptographic implementations. Therefore we introduce a new model, the bounded moment model, that formalizes a weaker notion of security order frequently used in the side-channel literature. Interestingly, we prove that probing security for a serial implementation implies bounded moment security for its parallel counterpart. This result therefore enables an accurate understanding of the links between formal security analyses of masking schemes and experimental security evaluations based on the estimation of statistical moments. Besides its consolidating nature, our work also brings useful technical contributions. First, we describe and analyze refreshing and multiplication algorithms that are well suited for parallel implementations and improve security against multivariate side-channel attacks. Second, we show that simple refreshing algorithms (with linear complexity) that are not secure in the continuous probing model are secure in the continuous bounded moment model. Eventually, we discuss the independent leakage assumption required for masking to deliver its security promises, and its speciﬁcities related to the serial or parallel nature of an implementation.},

We tested the attack with an actual implementation, which required just 216 chosen plaintexts and a few seconds on a single PC to ﬁnd the 217 bits of information in all the unknown elements of the scheme.},

Under exactly the same hypotheses as in a Diﬀerential Power Analysis (DPA), we describe an improvement of the previously introduced higherorder techniques allowing us to defeat masked implementations in a low (i.e. practically tractable) number of measurements. The proposed technique is based on the eﬃcient use of the statistical distributions of the power consumption in an actual design. It is conﬁrmed both by theoretical predictions and practical experiments against FPGA devices.},

	abstractnote = {In the execution on a smart card, side channel attacks such as simple power analysis (SPA) and the differential power analysis (DPA) have become serious threat. Side channel attacks monitor power consumption and even exploit the leakage information related to power consumption to reveal bits of a secret key d although d is hidden inside a smart card. Almost public key cryptosystems including RSA, DLP-based cryptosystems, and elliptic curve cryptosystems execute an exponentiation algorithm with a secret-key exponent, and they thus suffer from both SPA and DPA. Recently, in the case of elliptic curve cryptosystems, DPA is improved to the Refined Power Analysis (RPA), which exploits a special point with a zero value and reveals a secret key. RPA is further generalized to Zero-value Point Attack (ZPA). Both RPA and ZPA utilizes a special feature of elliptic curves that happens to have a special point or a register used in addition and doubling formulae with a zero value and that the power consumption of 0 is distinguishable from that of an non-zero element. To make the matters worse, some previous efficient countermeasures are neither resistant against RPA nor ZPA. Although a countermeasure to RPA is proposed, this is not a universal countermeasure, gives each different method to each type of elliptic curves, and is still vulnerable against ZPA. The possible countermeasures are ES and the improved version. This paper focuses on countermeasures against RPA, ZPA, DPA and SPA. We show a novel countermeasure resistant against RPA, ZPA, SPA and DPA without any pre-computed table. We also generalize the countermeasure to present more efficient algorithm with a pre-computed table.}
